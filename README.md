# Hurricanes Data

----


## Project Overview



---


- In this project, I analyzed data from the [_International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship(IB-TrACS)_](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/international-best-track-archive-for-climate-stewardship-ibtracs/v04r00/access/csv/) website.


- The data contains __hurricane data in the North Atlantic from years 1980 to 2019__. Through exploratory data analysis and visualizations I was able to answer key questions about the data. 
- My use of EDA helped either confirm or deny the following claims:

      A) A typical hurricane season (during a calendar year) runs from June through November,but occasionally storms form outside those months.
      B) A typical year has 12 named storms, including six hurricanes of which three becomemajor hurricanes (category 3, 4, and 5).
      C) September is the most active month (where most of the hurricanes occur), followed byAugust, and October.
      D) During the analyzed period (1980-2019), no hurricanes made U.S. landfall before Juneand after November.
      


## Logistics


---

- This project was written in `R` with the use of `dplyr` for data analysis and `ggplot2` for visualizations. 

- Two files are included: the RMD file of my report and analysis as well as an HTML version.
